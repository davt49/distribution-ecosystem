          <p>This dissertation is about the distribution marketplace that is changing rapidly in recent years due to the focus on video-on-demand and online platforms. From modest beginnings, it has enjoyed exponential growth in the past 10 years. Back in 2007, VOD services and internet distribution attracted so little consumer traffic as to be virtually worthless (McDonald 2007: 176), however, by 2015, SVOD, Cable VOD and TVOD accounted for 71% of movie and TV rental market revenue in the US (Statistica 2017) and the VOD market in the UK grew by 416% from 2002 to 2013 (BFI 2014). Such statistics of short-term growth suggests that this sector of the market has the potential to be a substantial source of revenue for film and television.</p><br/>

          <p>The popularity of subscription VOD platforms, most notably Netflix and Amazon, can be understood, with such platforms, consumers can now download or stream any content or movie anywhere, anytime through their devices in exchange for a simple monthly fee. Consumers can watch their selected movies and television programmes according to their schedules. It has quickly become a matter of convenience that everybody has embraced. Netflix are spending enormous sums in acquisition, as well as signing deals with major creative talents for their original programming in order to keep the consumer interest in their subscription. With the two platforms projected to overtake UK box office revenue by 2021 (Deadline 2017), the shift in consumer activity is clear, and distribution companies are now eager to work with SVOD platforms on many projects. With other major online companies such as Facebook (The Verge 2017) and Apple (Deadline 2017) investing in original content production, fierce competition will be expected. However, the arrival of SVOD caused disruptions through the traditional distribution market, dominated by major studios and heavyweight mini-majors. Digital aggregators play a significant role in managing and delivering content for VOD services, aggregators such as Premiere Digital and Kinonation have direct relationships with various platforms and often do not take an ownership stake in the content. Alongside streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, businesses focusing on delivering and creating content for VOD are breaking into a marketplace that is normally established and controlled. But as to whether they will completely displace the existing power-influences within the established distribution networks remains to be seen.</p><br/>

          <p>In the meantime, online marketplaces such as iTunes and Amazon have become the most popular destination for transactional VOD activities. This sector in particular drives down demand for physical DVD sales, as online downloads become the convenient replacement for home entertainment. DVD and Blu-ray’s are slowly becoming replaced, this is apparent with companies such as HMV, a leading physical entertainment seller in the UK and Canada, as their demand is almost evaporating. in January 2017, the company was unable to come to an agreement with major suppliers to sustain operations, and as a result, have confirmed to close all 102 stores in Canada (Financial Post 2017). With the boom in video-on-demand, DVDs have become an artifact of another technological age.</p><br/>

          <p>The ease of access of digital content through the internet has been improving, and for starter companies, it’s now easier than ever to establish an OTT service simply by the virtue of having access to the internet. The ability for content to reach a global audience is easier, as the newest releases become available through streaming or download services, it no longer requires consumers to watch content through cinemas or follow a fixed schedule on a cable channel. Although due to different systems of copyright laws and political influences, content available in the UK and US might not necessarily be able to reach audiences from China or Russia, therefore, each territory will require a different strategy. For content producers, there is now a multitude of platforms in which to sell their content’s rights and in turn, discover more streams of revenue. The distributors with the connections and access to many territories remain highly influential in this process. The Asia region, in particular, has huge potential, and the industry has seen companies from Asia accounted for the majority of new businesses at Cannes 2017 (Variety 2017), while China is on track to become the number one film market by 2019 (Variety 2016).</p><br/>

          <p>Adversely, these new levels of access contributed to a growth in online piracy. A problem which, after new control measures by local authorities and collective strategy by businesses, remains hard to contain. The underlying economic loss of revenue in pirated content is significant and a pressing issue for businesses. Many have noted that the release windows, which traditionally restricts access to consumers, need to be cut short for various reasons, one of which was piracy, which filled the gap between theatrical release and VOD release, where there are no legal means to watch the content.</p><br/>

          <p>The focus of this dissertation paper is to look into all of the aforementioned developments and issues and analyse the ways in which this digital marketplace function, in order to gain a better understanding of the VOD ecosystem as well as to anticipate the changes that could be coming in the next few years and beyond.</p>
