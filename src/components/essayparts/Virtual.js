          <p>Technology has been developing at a dramatic pace and digital distribution is an ecosystem that is constantly changing in relation to technological advances. This chapter is dedicated to the developments in the future and what the implications may be for digital distribution.</p><br/>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is a technology that is advancing fast, using AI algorithms, it presents streaming platforms with an effective way of improving productivity while limiting human errors. In the case of Netflix, the platform had collaborated with the University of Southern California and The University of Nantes to train its AI algorithm called the Digital Optimizer, a method of reviewing each frame of a video and compressing it to the degree necessary without degrading the image quality. The method addresses bandwidth and data caps issues in emerging markets as well as tailoring content for consumers watching on mobile devices (Motley Fool 2017). Netflix also applies AI on its content recommendation. With $6 billion worth of film and television content in 2017 (CNBC 2017), simply presenting the most popular selections would not be adequate as many programs will remain unseen, so personalised recommendation would maximise the chances for the right content to reach the right audience. According to Netflix, the take-rate based on personalised recommendation was three to four times higher than of a list of most popular titles (Valuewalk 2016).</p><br/>

          <p>Looking ahead, one of the newest forms of consumer technology gaining popularity is virtual reality. With leading developers Oculus Rift and Samsung VR, virtual reality headsets are now on the market at affordable prices. Originally intended to enhance the gaming experience (Guardian 2015), engineers, game developers and now filmmakers have been experimenting with the immersive medium. Alejandro Iñárritu’s VR project Carne y Arena has explored the possibilities of the medium. Working with frequent collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki, the piece attempts to put the viewer physically and emotionally in the shoes of a Mexican immigrant crossing the border to the US (The Verge 2017). For the few groups of people who could experience the installation (Kermode Uncut 2017), some noted the intense emotional experience from the piece (The Verge 2017) while others praised the resounding political statement (Variety 2017). Although this particular creation was engineered by two Oscar-winning filmmakers, lesser-known creatives have found recognition in their work in VR. The winner of cinematic virtual reality at Sundance 2017, Dear Angelica, written and directed by Saschka Unseld, presented a sentimental world created within the vast canvas of the medium. Created with Oculus Rift’s Quill, a 3D illustration tool for virtual reality, the VR animation piece directs the viewer’s attention in the darkness through reveals of its layered, colourful virtual paintings and immersive sound design (Wired 2017). With both Carne y Arena and Dear Angelica, the creative industry is presented with an artistic medium with huge unexplored potential.</p><br/>

          <p>While Netflix sparked a debate around SVOD and the cinematic experience at Cannes 2017, Virtual Reality has entered the wider consciousness within the film industry for the first time, with Carne y Arena becoming one of the most popular screenings at the festival (Hollywood Reporter 2017). Iñárritu argued that virtual reality and cinema are completely different mediums and that VR will not replace cinema (Hollywood Reporter 2017). Mark Kermode acknowledged that there are some circumstances in which virtual reality can put the viewer into an experience that is not replicable in another medium and that both should coexist in the future (Kermode Uncut 2017). The discussions contributed to the growing intrigue about the possibilities of virtual reality.</p><br/>

          <p>As the future of movie theatres are under stress from streaming platforms and premium content, some suggested the introduction of virtual reality into multiplexes could be the new draw for audiences. IMAX CEO Rich Gelford noted that virtual reality embodies similar characteristics to the IMAX format of theatrical presentation such as immersion and active viewing, and the company has recently announced a $50 million fund for VR content as well as working with Google and Acer to develop VR technologies (Wired 2017). Location-based VR is also a project undertaking by IMAX, Gelford intends to put VR experiences in cinema multiplexes, and the company has plans to establish six pilot locations around the world in the future including US, UK, China and Japan (SCMP 2017). It remains to be seen whether the business opportunities as well as public reception that IMAX is pioneering with the VR experience centres can influence a transformation in the exhibition sector.</p><br/>

          <div className='conclusion-title'> Conclusion</div>

          <p>From the Lumiere Brothers’ first films in 1895 to a century later, Toy Story, the first fully computer-generated feature film in 1995, technology has always been utilised by filmmakers for creative expression, and virtual reality has become the latest technology to push the boundaries of imagination. While the technology is still developing, the possibility of VR becoming a major creative addition to the film and media industry is highly likely in the future. For exhibitors, they may need to look into new innovations and technologies in preserving their businesses. IMAX’s investment into VR opens up future possibilities of cinema multiplex locations being transformed into entertainment centres for the age of virtual reality. In the mean time, developments in artificial intelligence are benefiting recommendation systems of streaming services such as Netflix, and the platform utilises the technology to maintain viewer’s interest in its content, and in turn maximising their business potential.</p><br/>
