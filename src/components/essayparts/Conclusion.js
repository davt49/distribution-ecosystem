        <div className='section-title'>Conclusion: The Next Stage of the Film and Television Experience</div>
        <div className='text'>
          <p>The internet has fundamentally changed the ways in which consumers obtain information and has transformative effects on the film and television industry. With the introduction of video-on-demand and ad-free streaming services, technology has changed the distribution ecosystem once more. Back in the 1930s, television used to be a simple business, with the single-channel broadcast experience such as the BBC in 1936 (BBC 2017) and a duo-channel equivalent in the US with NBC and CBS in 1939 (Emmy 2017), a few high ranking executives could decide what families would watch every day and night on broadcast television. The arrival of cable TV was a major disruption to the system, and it established the cable channels as the new centre of power instead of broadcast studios. A few decades later, the internet has released the distribution monopoly to OTT services (Forbes 2015), contributing to the fact that the conveniency of online content has diminished the significance of traditional sources of information from printed mass media to linear television.</p><br/>

          <p>Back in 1996, Bill Gates said in his essay that ‘Content is King’, and that those who utilise the internet medium to deliver information and entertainment will be the big winners in the internet age (Gates 1996 cited in Medium 2017). ‘Content’, as Gates described, includes not only cultural products such as film, television and music, but also popular content from online edition news to computer softwares. He argued that content created for the internet would be just as profitable as television content, which was a bold statement at the time considering only around ten million users in total were on the internet (Business Insider 2014). Advertising had been a steady revenue stream for television since the beginning (Fortune 2016), but its grip on the mass audience had loosened. Currently, much of advertising spending by businesses are moving towards digital, and it is expected to overtake advertising on cable television in 2018 (AMA 2017). The shift in advertising expenses indicates a significant change brought about by the internet. With the success of easily accessible SVOD services and their confidence in investing tremendous capital into original content destined for their online platforms, Gates’ prediction was correct. The Internet has provided consumers around the world an indispensable vehicle for information and efficiency, and businesses are capitalising on the most important invention in the twentieth century.</p><br/>

          <p>Video-on-demand is the next stage of the film and television experience. It presented new possibilities in content viewing that were previously restricted to cable television and film projectors. Innovators are establishing themselves within this new market of opportunities, and they have been influential in challenging existing market structures as well as building new business models within the digital distribution ecosystem. With the widespread popularity of video-on-demand, consumers can more efficiently manage their time and focus by not being restricted to linear mass media or a television screen, and it has all been made possible thanks to the invention of the internet. </p><br/>
