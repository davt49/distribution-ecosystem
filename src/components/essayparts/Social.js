          <p>The rise of social media has opened up opportunities for production and distribution companies seeking to advertise and market their content. The social networking site Facebook has an active user count of 2 billion per month, while Twitter has 328 million active users per month and Instagram, also owned by Facebook, has 700 million active users per month (Statista 2017). In addition to marketing spend on the platforms, studios are using data analytics from advertising with social platforms to accurately generate interest for the content they produce. STX Entertainment, a relatively new production studio in California founded in 2014, utilises data from working with Facebook to be informed about their important creative decisions. For their horror feature The Bye Bye Man, the studio found out through working with Facebook’s ‘brand lift study’ (A polling system that asks questions regarding brand awareness and message association) was that their first and original trailer, in a horizontal and 16:9 aspect ratio, was not generating enough interest within their target demographic. Five months later, the company updated their trailer to optimize for viewing on mobile devices with square and vertical formats as well as showing more engaging content in its first few seconds to grab attention. The new trailer improved the awareness and intent on watching the movie significantly (Facebook 2017). Despite the generally unfavorable reviews (Metacritic 2017), the film was a commercial success, earning $25 million at box office worldwide against a $7.4 million budget (The Numbers 2017). According to Amy Elkins, senior vice-president in media and marketing, by focusing on data analysis through social platforms, studio executives are happy because it becomes ‘less about their gut and more about reacting to meaningful information’ and there is a smaller sense of risk (Cio 2017).</p><br/>

          <p>Big data analysis is also being used for platform programming. When Netflix funded House of Cards, the platform knew the show has huge potential to be a hit. Through its extensive data collected from its viewers, Netflix already had a good idea that a high portion of its viewers streamed films by David Fincher and Kevin Spacey, and that the British version of House of Cards was very popular on the platform, so combining these three circles of interest gave them confidence to create the show (New York Times 2013). Amazon, on the other hand, has the practice of Amazon Previews, which invites some of its subscribers to view and provide feedback on their upcoming productions, sharing such as storyboards, test movies and pilots. The information the audience provides will in turn inform them of crucial audience response to the projects (Amazon 2017). </p><br/>

          <p>When asked about what marketing examples in recent memory that stood out for him, Mueller suggested the runaway success story of sports drinks company Red Bull, which was struggling in sales when it was first launched. Rather than investing millions on print and advertising, the company launched a guerilla marketing campaign, employing students to drive specially-designed cars with a massive Red Bull can attached at the top. The students drove around university campuses offering free samples at parties and the word of mouth promotion through students proved hugely successful, and Red Bull saw boosted sales dramatically (Gschwandtner 2004). Since then, Red Bull has consistently branded itself with sporting events by sponsoring extreme sports events such as cliff diving, BMX and motor sports, as well as investing in sports teams such as New York Red Bulls and Red Bull Racing. The launch of their global free-to-view VOD platform, Red Bull TV, also enhanced their brand identity as a specialist sponsor of extreme sports. Their engagements, in turn, associates the brand with consumer feelings of energy, excitement and sportsmanship.</p><br/>

          <p>Similarly to Red Bull’s branded marketing that targets sports fans, Mubi targets their own group of consumers in their advertising campaigns. In 2015, Mubi collaborated with photographer Jason Evans for a campaign which appeared on the London Underground. The series of imagery each used one word to describe a feeling that relates to the film it was metaphorically portraying. For example, ‘Screwed- feel it with Shame (2011)’  featured a dented screw, or ‘Crushed- feel it with Gomorrah (2008)’ featured a crushed fly. The ads were simple, humorous and unconventional, and it targeted a demographic that enjoys more challenging and less mainstream content (Mueller 2017). As for Mubi’s marketing strategy, Mueller noted that the company uses a wide range of activities to market its content and maintain loyalty of the consumers. Firstly, maintaining strong partnerships with many organisations in ‘press, film festivals, cinema chains, distribution partners, platforms and devices’ is key, as well as making sure the service is available on as many platform as possible. Secondly, utilising paid media for Mubi’s exclusive releases and programming series. Search enhancement options such as AdWords by Google, which helps target people who are looking for films to watch, looking for a specific talent or keywords. Thirdly, using word of mouth to build a loyal customer base and a practice of sending gifts to customers who invite enough people through referrals. In addition, the company seeks to build a reputation in the industry and community through their daily film magazine Notebook (Mueller 2017). Mubi’s marketing strategy reflects the need and demand for their target demographic and has been instrumental in the success in their streaming platform.</p><br/>

          <p>For feature films that utilised social media for their marketing campaign, one of the more successful examples in recent years has been Deadpool. From the start, the movie had a lot stacked against it. The superhero wasn’t hugely known within the Marvel universe, while the studio had to go with an R-rating, which restricted its audience (Ad Age 2016). With the movie not being able to be advertised as a family-friendly blockbuster, the studio decided to focus on Deadpool as a character and created an abundance of promotional content. The material had a tongue-in-cheek comedy style that sometimes involved sexual innuendos. They were wide-ranging, territory-targeted and cross-platform. They created billboard posters that were almost irrelevant to the movie other than the title and used tongue-in-cheek humour connected with the protagonist. There were videos of Deadpool explaining how men and women can check for testicular and breast cancer, which related to the fact that the character himself is a cancer survivor. Lead star Ryan Reynolds also utilised his own social media pages to generate buzz for the movie, as well as appearing on US talk shows (Wired 2016). The marketing team targeted specific territories too, by hiring local comedy writers, they intended to ‘piggyback on local cultural events’, according to Paul Hanneman, Distribution-Marketing president at Fox, to make the film more locally relevant. For the Chinese market they created a Chinese New Year message; For Australia they created an Australia Day message; They created posters calling for people to ‘Vote for Deadpool’ during the Italian and South Korean elections; In the UK they partnered with Manchester United to create a promotional video, featuring football stars from the club (Deadline 2016). They even created an account on dating app Tinder. Most of the material have no relation to the movie’s plot itself but acted as an introduction to Deadpool, and greatly humanized the character. The marketing campaign proved hugely successful and generated colossal anticipation for the movie, on its opening weekend it earned $130 million and became the biggest opening ever for an R-rated movie (Ad Age 2016). Worldwide theatrical earnings alone reached $800 million against a budget of $58 million (The Numbers 2017). </p><br/>

          <p>In many ways, social media has become an essential part of daily life for the majority of people around the world, and tailoring a movie’s marketing campaign for digital platforms is key. The marketing success stories of Red Bull and Deadpool have lessons to be learnt. Successfully utilising multiple platforms in a cohesive, innovative manner will enhance the chances of marketing efforts reaching as wide an audience as possible. Specifically designed content for different territories will go a long way in establishing relevance for local audiences.
